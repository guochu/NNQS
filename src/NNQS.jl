module NNQS

# there are 5 important imgredients for Neural Network Quantum States:
# 1) The Neural Network Quantum States ansatz, which accept a computational basis and returns its amplitude
# 2) The Markov Chain sampling algorithm
# 3) a way to randomly change the computational basis, which may reflect the symmetry of the model
# 4) The variational Monte Carlo algorithm, the essense of which is to evaluate the gradients.
# 5) The Hamiltonian representation which allows to efficiently derive coupled states given an computational basis
